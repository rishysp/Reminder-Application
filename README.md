# Reminder-Application
The official Time Table of the University and Student details is being uploaded into the database. With the data present, we are getting the Classes for the day and sends message to the concerned student on time with a trigger in the starting of the day. 
In this appliaction, the Alarm system is used and instead of ringing, it sends a message to the respective users to remind them that they have an event now.
This even is broadcasted so that it happens for the whole day. It checks for every hour in the database for a class and as it finds the schedule, the alarm is triggered and message is sent!!
